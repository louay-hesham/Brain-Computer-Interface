# Brain Computer Interface
This is a bachelor's degree graduation project (paper can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVwkSBht_00Z7X0cddTFLdb7mIket3BEhVfBotCa1Dc/edit?usp=sharing)). We (hopefully) increase the accuracy of movement predicting using BCI. Also, using Emokit and Emotiv EPOC neuro headset, we can provide real time proessing of EEG data.

## Modified Emokit
A slightly modified version of the [original Emokit](https://github.com/openyou/emokit). Check the readme inside its folder for more info on what has been modified.
